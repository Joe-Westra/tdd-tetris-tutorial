 * The game works up next:
 -Implementing the missing tests
 -Increase scoring
 -Implement speed changes
 -Add Highscore list
 
 -Fix known bugs:
 (some game overs are so severe they don't throw an IllegalStateException)
 (moveRight() and moveLeft() are a bit buggy)
 (pausing doesn't lock keyboard commands)
