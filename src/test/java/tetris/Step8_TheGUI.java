 * The game works. Up next:
 -Implementing the missing tests
 -DONE: Increase scoring(bonus points for dropping to bottom)
 -DONE: Implement speed changes
 -Add Highscore list

 -Fix known bugs:
FIXED (some game overs are so severe they don't throw an IllegalStateException)
FIXED (moveRight() and moveLeft() are a bit buggy)
FIXED (pausing doesn't lock keyboard commands)
Keypad events still fire when the game is over
