 * FIGURE OUT WHY THE 7th TEST SUITE ISN'T WORKING.
 -Implementing the missing tests
    *DONE: for new shapes
    *for speed changes
    *for the GUI
    *for pausing & game overs
 - Serious refactoring
    *Clean up keyEvents
    *Implement a better for-each for pieces
    *Add colours to the Tetromino Class Types
 -DONE: Increase scoring(bonus points for dropping to bottom)
 -DONE: Implement speed changes
 -Add Highscore list

 -Fix known bugs:
FIXED (some game overs are so severe they don't throw an IllegalStateException)
FIXED (moveRight() and moveLeft() are a bit buggy)
FIXED (pausing doesn't lock keyboard commands)
FIXED (Keypad events still fire when the game is over)
